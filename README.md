This project employs a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify Capuchin bird calls. The goal is to train a model that can distinguish Capuchin bird species from their vocalizations, using audio recordings as input.

Project Overview:

Objective: Classify Capuchin bird calls using CNN.
Model: CNN-based deep learning model.
Data: Audio files of Capuchin bird calls.
Technologies Used: TensorFlow, Keras, Librosa, NumPy.
